              Scene.-A ruined chapel by moonlight.</h4>
    <p>
        CHORUS

            Oh, dry the glist'ning tear
                 That dews that martial cheek,
            Thy loving children hear,
                 In them thy comfort seek.
            With sympathetic care
                 Their arms around thee creep,
            For oh, they cannot bear
                 To see their father weep!

       (Enter MABEL)

                              SOLO—MABEL

            Dear father, why leave your bed
                 At this untimely hour,
            When happy daylight is dead,
                 And darksome dangers low'r?
            See, heav'n has lit her lamp,
                 The midnight hour is past,
            And the chilly night-air is damp,
                 And the dews are falling fast!
            Dear father, why leave your bed
                 When happy daylight is dead?

  GIRLS:    Oh, dry the glist'ning tear, etc.

       (FREDERIC enters)

  MABEL:    Oh, Frederic, cannot you, in the calm excellence of
            your wisdom, reconcile it with your conscience to say
            something that will relieve my father's sorrow?
  FREDERIC: I will try, dear Mabel.  But why does he sit, night
            after night, in this draughty old ruin?
  GENERAL:  Why do I sit here?  To escape from the pirates'
            clutches, I described myself as an orphan; and, heaven
            help me, I am no orphan!  I come here to humble myself
            before the tombs of my ancestors, and to implore their
            pardon for having brought dishonour on the family
            escutcheon.
  FREDERIC: But you forget, sir, you only bought the property a
            year ago, and the stucco on your baronial castle is
            scarcely dry.
  GENERAL:  Frederic, in this chapel are ancestors: you cannot deny
            that.  With the estate, I bought the chapel and its
            contents.  I don't know whose ancestors they were, but
            I know whose ancestors they are, and I shudder to think
            that their descendant by purchase (if I may so describe
            myself) should have brought disgrace upon what, I have
            no doubt, was an unstained escutcheon.
  FREDERIC: Be comforted.  Had you not acted as you did, these
            reckless men would assuredly have called in the nearest
            clergyman, and have married your large family on the
            spot.
  GENERAL:  I thank you for your proffered solace, but it is
            unavailing.  I assure you, Frederic, that such is the
            anguish and remorse I feel at the abominable falsehood
            by which I escaped these easily deluded pirates, that I
            would go to their simple-minded chief this very night
            and confess all, did I not fear that the consequences
            would be most disastrous to myself.  At what time does
            your expedition march against these scoundrels?
  FREDERIC: At eleven, and before midnight I hope to have atoned
            for my involuntary association with the pestilent
            scourges by sweeping them from the face of the earth—
            and then, dear Mabel, you will be mine!
  GENERAL:  Are your devoted followers at hand?
  FREDERIC: They are, they only wait my orders.

                           RECIT—GENERAL

            Then, Frederic, let your escort lion-hearted
            Be summoned to receive a gen'ral's blessing,
            Ere they depart upon their dread adventure.

  FREDERIC: Dear, sir, they come.

  (Enter POLICE, marching in single file. They form in line, facing
       audience.)

                           SONG—SERGEANT

       When the foeman bares his steel,
                      Tarantara!  tarantara!
       We uncomfortable feel,
                      Tarantara!
       And we find the wisest thing,
                      Tarantara!  tarantara!
       Is to slap our chests and sing,
                      Tarantara!
       For when threatened with -meutes,
                      Tarantara! tarantara!
       And your heart is in your boots,
                      Tarantara!
       There is nothing brings it round
       Like the trumpet's martial sound,
       Like the trumpet's martial sound
                      Tarantara! tarantara!, etc.

  MABEL:    Go, ye heroes, go to glory,
            Though you die in combat gory,
            Ye shall live in song and story.
                 Go to immortality!
            Go to death, and go to slaughter;
            Die, and every Cornish daughter
            With her tears your grave shall water.
                 Go, ye heroes, go and die!

  GIRLS:    Go, ye heroes, go and die!  Go, ye heroes, go and die!

  POLICE:   Though to us it's evident,
                      Tarantara!  tarantara!
            These attentions are well meant,
                      Tarantara!
            Such expressions don't appear,
                      Tarantara!  tarantara!
            Calculated men to cheer
                      Tarantara!
            Who are going to meet their fate
            In a highly nervous state.
                      Tarantara! tarantara! tarantara!
            Still to us it's evident
            These attentions are well meant.
                      Tarantara! tarantara! tarantara!

  EDITH:    Go and do your best endeavour,
            And before all links we sever,
            We will say farewell for-ever.
                 Go to glory and the grave!

  GIRLS:    For your foes are fierce and ruthless,
            False, unmerciful, and truthless;
            Young and tender, old and toothless,
                 All in vain their mercy crave.

  SERGEANT: We observe too great a stress,
            On the risks that on us press,
            And of reference a lack
            To our chance of coming back.
            Still, perhaps it would be wise
            Not to carp or criticise,
            For it's very evident
            These attentions are well meant.

  POLICE:   Yes, it's very evident
            These attentions are well meant,
            Evident, yes, well meant, evident
            Ah, yes, well meant!

                              ENSEMBLE

       Chorus of all but Police                  Chorus of Police

  Go and do your best endeavour,        Such expressions don't
  appear,
  And before all links we sever                    Tarantara,
  tarantara!
  We will say farewell for ever.        Calculated men to cheer,
       Go to glory and the grave!                  Tarantara!
  For your foes and fierce and          Who are going to their fate,
       ruthless,                                   Tarantara,
  tarantara!
  False, unmerciful, and                In a highly nervous state—
       truthless.                                  Tarantara!
  Young and tender, old and             We observe too great a
  stress,
       toothless,                                  Tarantara,
  tarantara!
  All in vain their mercy crave.        On the risks that on us
  press,
                                                   Tarantara!
                                        And of reference a lack,
                                                   Tarantara,
  tarantara!
                                        To our chance of coming back,
                                                   Tarantara!
